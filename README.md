In this work, I present the development of a tweet classification model aimed at identifying political affiliations in Spain, categorizing tweets into five distinct classes: Partido Popular (PP), Partido Socialista Obrero Espa√±ol (PSOE), Ciudadanos, Podemos, and Vox. This task addresses the challenge of discerning political discourse on social media, which is crucial for understanding public sentiment and the spread of political messages.

I experimented with three transformer-based models: RoBERTuito, BETO, and RoBERTa, each of which is pre-trained on different linguistic and contextual datasets relevant to the Spanish language. These models were fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of tweets, which were manually classified according to their political alignment. After evaluation, the best-performing model achieved a macro F1-score of 71% and an accuracy of 72%, demonstrating the effectiveness of transformers in handling political text classification.
