In this work, we present the development of a tweet classification model aimed at identifying political affiliations in Spain, categorizing tweets into five distinct classes: Partido Popular (PP), Partido Socialista Obrero Espa√±ol (PSOE), Ciudadanos, Podemos, and Vox. This task addresses the challenge of discerning political discourse on social media, which is crucial for understanding public sentiment and the spread of political messages.

We experimented with three transformer-based models: RoBERTuito, BETO, and RoBERTa, each of which is pre-trained on different linguistic and contextual datasets relevant to the Spanish language. These models were fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of tweets, which were manually classified according to their political alignment. After evaluation, the best-performing model achieved a macro F1-score of 71% and an accuracy of 72%, demonstrating the effectiveness of transformers in handling political text classification.
